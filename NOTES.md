# Grid positions
A ten by ten grid:  
`[[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]`  
Each list in the initial list is a row on the x axis.  
Example:  
`[x=0=>[block(x=0,z=0), block(x=0,z=1)], x=1=>[], x=2=>[], x=3=>[], x=4=[], etc.]`


# Chunk positions compared to block positions
Chunk positions are different from block positions




**If block is close to this border and this border, it is in that chunk?**
